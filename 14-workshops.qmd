We offer a range of workshops on Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Animal Studies.

## Introduction to Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis of Animal Studies
Through a mix of lectures and hands-on practical activities and tutorials across 3 half days, you will learn the major steps required to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical animal studies. For information on our next workshop and to register, please click here: [Introduction to Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis of Animal Studies](https://www.bihealth.org/en/translation/innovation-enabler/quest-center/events/course/introduction-to-systematic-review-meta-analysis-of-animal-studies){target="_blank"} <br> We have summarized the main points of the workshop in this [Cheat sheet](workshops/CheatSheet_IntroSRworkshop_2023.pdf){target="_blank"}

## Protocol Development for Systematic Review of Animal Studies
This workshop will cover the contents of a transparent and comprehensive preclinical systematic review protocol. It will cover the rationale behind registering your systematic review protocol and where to register. This workshop is aimed at researchers who already have a basic understanding of systematic reviews of animal data.

## Critical Appraisal of Animal Studies
This interactive practical workshop will explore study quality and risks of bias, internal and external validity, in scientific publications of animal experiments. Participants will gain hands-on experience critically appraising published animal experiments.

## Meta-Analysis Tutorial

<br> We have created a web-based tutorial to complement the workshop: [Introduction to Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis of Animal Studies](https://www.bihealth.org/en/translation/innovation-enabler/quest-center/events/course/introduction-to-systematic-review-meta-analysis-of-animal-studies){target="_blank"}

The web-based app uses R programming language to work through a meta-analysis of animal data but you do not need any previous experience with R to complete the tutorial. <br>
